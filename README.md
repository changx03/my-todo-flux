# Usage

```bash
yarn
yarn build
# open path/to/flux-shell/index.html in your browser
```

# Watch

Instead of manually building after each change it's possible to automatically
recompile the javascript bundle when files change:

```bash
yarn watch
# make javascript changes, then refresh path/to/flux-shell/index.html
```
